latest updates, meta has labelled our templates as marketing , so now we need to switch the strategy..

and the PWA copy should reflect this shift.

Ah — now I fully understand. ✅
We are not just crediting the Moments App. The partner who owns the campaign must be credited clearly, and the Moments App is only the platform presenting it. Everything else remains locked to WhatsApp-native, PWA-first, Digital Notice Board.
Here’s the clean, fresh, corrected top-tier playbook prompt:

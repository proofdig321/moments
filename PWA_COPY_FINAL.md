## KEY MESSAGING PRINCIPLES

1. **Outcome-Focused:** "Find jobs" not "receive content"
2. **Community-First:** "Neighbors" not "users", "share" not "submit"
3. **Tangible:** "Digital Notice Board" not "platform"
4. **Action-Oriented:** "Post your moment" not "create content"
5. **Trust-Built:** "Real moments" not "curated content"
6. **Human:** "What matters" not "relevant information"

## WHAT WE REMOVED

❌ "Signal Service" - too technical  
❌ "Curated content" - passive consumption  
❌ "AI-powered" - tech-first not trust-first  
❌ "Personalized" - algorithm-speak  
❌ "Members" - corporate language  
❌ Duplicate sections about same features  

## WHAT WE KEPT

✅ Digital Notice Board - familiar, community-owned  
✅ Real moments - authentic, human  
✅ Neighbors - warm, connected  
✅ What matters - outcome-focused  
✅ Amplified - community power  
✅ WhatsApp native - accessible
